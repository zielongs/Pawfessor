10. FAQs (FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS)
================================================================================

Q: Do I need a real email address?
A: No, you can use any format (test@example.com). Real email is only needed
   if you want to receive notifications in the future.

Q: Can I change my email address?
A: Currently, email cannot be changed (it's the unique identifier). You would
   need to create a new account with a different email.

Q: How secure is my password?
A: Very secure! Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (industry standard). Even
   database administrators cannot see your actual password.

Q: What if I forget my security question answers?
A: Unfortunately, answers are also hashed and cannot be retrieved. You'll
   need to contact an administrator to reset your account.

Q: Can I use the same password for multiple accounts?
A: Technically yes, but NOT recommended for security reasons. Use unique
   passwords for different accounts.

Q: How long is my session active?
A: Sessions last until you logout or close your browser (browser dependent).
   Some browsers keep sessions active even after closing.

Q: Can I have multiple accounts with the same name?
A: Yes! Names don't have to be unique. Only email addresses must be unique.

Q: What happens if I enter wrong password multiple times?
A: Currently, there's no lockout. You can keep trying (but be careful of
   typos and caps lock).

Q: Can I delete my account?
A: Contact an administrator to delete your account. This feature may be
   added in future updates.

Q: Is my data safe?
A: Yes! All sensitive data is encrypted/hashed. The system uses prepared
   statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Q: Can I use special characters in my password?
A: Yes! You can use letters, numbers, and special characters. The only
   requirements are: 8+ characters, contains letters and numbers.

Q: What's the difference between user and admin accounts?
A: Admin accounts have access to admin dashboard and management features.
   Regular users have access to user dashboard and personal features.

Q: Can I upgrade from free to premium plan?
A: The subscription_plan field exists in the database. This feature can be
   implemented based on your needs.

Q: Do I need to set up security questions?
A: It's optional but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Without security questions, your
   account is less secure during password reset.

Q: Can I change my security questions?
A: Yes! Visit setup-security-questions.php anytime to update your questions
   and answers.

Q: What if the 6-digit code expires?
A: Just request a new code by going through the forgot password process
   again. Each code is valid for 1 hour.

Q: Can someone else reset my password if they know my email?
A: No! They also need to:
   1. Know your security question answers
   2. Have access to see the verification code
   Both are required to reset password.

Q: Why do I see "timezone" in some error messages?
A: This is fixed in the current version. Make sure your db.php includes
   the timezone settings for Malaysia (UTC+8).

Q: Can I use this system on a live server?
A: Yes! Just update these in db.php:
   - Database credentials
   - Change localhost to your domain
   - Update URLs in password reset emails (if using email)
